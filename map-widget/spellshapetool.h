 * @class SpellShapeTool
 * @brief A tool designed for handling shape-based operations within a graphical map-like environment.
 *
 * This class provides mechanisms for creating, manipulating, and removing graphical shapes in a
 * scene. It derives from AbstractMapTool and implements various mouse-driven interactions and
 * preview functionalities for shape-based content. Each instance of this tool modifies shapes
 * by interacting with a QGraphicsScene and utilizes color and preview features.
 *
 * The tool is abstract and requires derived classes to implement specific behavior for certain mouse events.
