 * - If the first point hasn't been set:

 *   - Otherwise, the first point of the line is set, and further interaction is awaited.
 * - If the first point has been set:
 *   - Right mouse button cancels the line creation process, resets the state,
 *     and clears any preview.
 *   - Left mouse button completes the line creation process by:
 *     - Adding a new, stylized line to the scene.
 *     - Registering the item as undoable in the scene.
 *     - Resetting the tool's state.
 *     - Clearing any previewed line.
 *
 * @param event A pointer to the QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent containing details of the mouse interaction.
 * @param scene A pointer to the QGraphicsScene in which the interaction occurs.
 *
 * The `hasFirstPoint` member variable tracks whether the first point of the line has been set.
 * The `color` member variable is used to define the color of the newly created line.
 * Helper methods `clearShapeAt` and `clearPreview` are used to manage scene state during the interaction process.
